### Progress Report - Red Disk Fraction project for 2016 AAS
*Melanie Galloway*

#### Background:

Continuing Tom Melvin's preliminary work at Portsmouth, I will be using the GZ:Hubble debiased catalog to study the evolution of the fraction of red disks (red disks / all disks) from redshift z=1.0 to z=0.2. 



#### The Sample

I begin with a sample of 84,350 galaxies from the COSMOS field which were classified in GZH. Of these, 70,198 had k-corrected colors and magnitudes in the UltraVISTA catalog. The number of these galaxies within the redshift range of interest 0.2 < z < 1.0 is 52,707. 

#### Surface Brightness + Redshift effects on p_features

*Fig. 2: Measured vs. true p_features as a function of redshift and surface brightness for the FERENGI galaxies. The flat bits of each bin show where the bias isn't single-valued, and thus we can't apply a correction.*

#### How many Hubble galaxies can this be applied to? What are their properties?


| | AEGIS| COSMOS| GEMS| GOODS-N| GOODS-S|SDSS| Total|
| -----| ------:|-----:| ------:|-----:| ------:|-----:| ------:|
| Correctable| 3115|24368| 3398|1298| 1299|0| 33478|
| Uncorrectable| 1411|22263| 1788|271| 1005|0| 26738|
| No Correction Needed (z<0.3)| 967|11693| 1190|280| 247|37545| 66299|
| NEI| 1667|27391| 1280|467| 1721|0| 32526|
| No Redshift Information| 1347|7093| 1648|235| 641|14316| 36244|



#### What's the overall effect of the applied correction?

#### What do we need to still do?

* Find a metric for evaluating whether the correction is doing a reasonable job
* Work through scientific use cases
* Test for any systematic differences between the different surveys in GZH (AEGIS, GEMS, GOODS, COSMOS)
* Compare to other samples of morphology over a similar redshift range, either through expert visual classification or parametric fits
