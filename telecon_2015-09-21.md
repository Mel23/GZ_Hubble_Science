### Progress Report - Red Disk Fraction project for 2016 AAS
*Melanie Galloway*

#### Background:

Continuing Tom Melvin's preliminary work at Portsmouth, I will be using the GZ:Hubble debiased catalog to study the evolution of the fraction of red disks (red disks / all disks) from redshift z=1.0 to z=0.2. 



#### The Sample

I begin with a sample of 84,350 galaxies from the COSMOS field which were classified in GZH. Of these, 70,198 had k-corrected colors and magnitudes in the UltraVISTA catalog. The number of these galaxies within the redshift range of interest ( 0.2 < z < 1.0 ) is 52,707. 

#### Surface Brightness + Redshift effects on p_features

*Fig. 1: Surface brightness (MU_HI parameter from Griffiths et al. 2012) vs. redshift for 70,198 COSMOS galaxies in GZH and UltraVISTA. Galaxies between 0.2 < z < 1.0 will be considered for analysis of red disk fraction; a surface brightness cut is still TBD.*

*Fig. 2: R band magnitude vs redshift for 70,198 COSMOS galaxies in GZH and UltraVISTA. Colors represent the average p_features value for galaxies in each bin; bins with fewer than 50 galaxies are masked. Left: p_features are the weighted (but uncorrected) values; low brightness and high redshift galaxies are biased to low values of p_features. The red boxed region was derived by T. Melvin, which identifies the region of M(R)-z space in which GZ users can reliably identify disk galaxies. Middle: This plot only shows the 'correctable' galaxies identified with the FERENGI data, and the colored p_features are the debiased values. These are biased to high p_features values espeically at high redshift and surface brightness. Right: the best p_features value is debiased if the galaxy is 'correctable,' the lower limit if it is 'uncorrectable,' and weighted if neither.

#### What do we need to still do?

* Find a metric for evaluating whether the correction is doing a reasonable job
* Work through scientific use cases
* Test for any systematic differences between the different surveys in GZH (AEGIS, GEMS, GOODS, COSMOS)
* Compare to other samples of morphology over a similar redshift range, either through expert visual classification or parametric fits
